The poem can only be appreciated by reading it aloud, to wit:

         Waka waka bang splat tick tick hash,
         Caret quote back-tick dollar dollar dash,
         Bang splat equal at dollar under-score,
         Percent splat waka waka tilde number four,
         Ampersand bracket bracket dot dot slash,
         Vertical-bar curly-bracket comma comma CRASH.
